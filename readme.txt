Quartz.Net web console is a simple drop-in web-console to manage Quartz.Net in windows services.

By default, console is available on http://localhost:1234/quartzconsole

If you wish to override default binding, just specify a new one using appSettings 'quartznet.webconsole.host' property.

Happy scheduling!
